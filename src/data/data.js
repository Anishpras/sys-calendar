    about: "Would be posted on the social media handles, should sound welcoming and empathetic I have completed my Masters in Psychology and currently work as a school counselor. With almost 5 years of experience in in-person as well as online counseling, I believe that the relationship I share with my client is extremely important. I understand that taking the step of booking a counseling session takes courage as it is difficult to allow ourselves to be vulnerable with others. I help clients focus on their strengths, look at new perspectives, learn coping skills and how they can use those to work on themselves and their overall mental health. I have experience with adolescents, young adults, young parents and professionals. Remember, one doesn't have to be at their lowest to seek help ",
